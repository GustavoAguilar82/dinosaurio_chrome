My "First Oficial" game ðŸ’š This is a personal project made just for fun and practice.
In this game, I practiced about the use of events in JavaScript, loops and mathematical calculations.
I hope, in a near future, could create another game but in vertical. The game will focus more in mathematical agility
instead of agile movements.~  

This portafolio is in proccess, and so many things are coming!!
